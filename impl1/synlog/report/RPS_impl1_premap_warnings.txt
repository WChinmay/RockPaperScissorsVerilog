@W: MT529 :"c:\lscc\diamond\3.10_x64\projects\rockpaperscissor\impl1\source\clock_counter.sv":12:2:12:10|Found inferred clock LED_top_module|clk_inferred_clock which controls 8 sequential elements including counter_1.count[6:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
